### Dog Shelter Feeding Helper
Application to manage a dog shelterâ€™s daily feeding schedule - keeping track of the feeding & the dietary information of dogs that come in.
Whether or not the dogs have been fed will reset each day. The dogs name & information will remain in the database until it has been deleted (adopted).

### MVP:
- Display of count of dogs in shelter, count of dogs that have been fed (eg. 15/20 dogs have been fed today)

- Menu to view which actions the user wishes to take, including (but not limited to?):
    - Add a dog & its information to the database (dogs name, dogs breed, dietary requirements/medication, any other notes e.g. fussy eater, only eats food at night, etc)
    - Edit dog information in database
    - View dogs & information (including dietary requirements/ in readable format)
    - How many meals need to be prepared across the shelter & how many have special dietary requirements
    - Mark (tick off) a dog that has been fed (adding to the count on home page)
    - View dogs (by name) that have/have not yet been fed
    - Delete dog from database (as it gets adopted)
